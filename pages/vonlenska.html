    <h3>
      Vonlenska (English: Hopelandic) is a term coined by the band to refer
      to the vocalizations that Jónsi sings on ( ) in lieu of lyrics in Icelandic
      or English. It takes its name from "Von", a song on Sigur Rós's
      debut album Von where it was first used. However, not all Sigur Rós songs
      are in Vonlenska; many are sung in Icelandic.

      Vonlenska differs from both natural and constructed languages used for
      human communication. It consists of strings of meaningless syllables
      containing non-lexical vocables and phonemes. There is no grammatical relation
      between or among syllables, nor are they accompanied by clearly defined
      word boundaries. Vonlenska emphasizes the phonological and emotive
      qualities of human vocalizations, and it uses the melodic and rhythmic elements
      of singing without the conceptual content of language. In this way, it is similar
      to the use of scat singing in vocal jazz and puirt à beul in traditional
      Scottish and Irish folk music. The band's website describes it as
      "a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music".
